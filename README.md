## Motivation
- Considering that somehow Google Maps does not support route arrangement for bikes in Taiwan, but there is still a large community that prefers bike riding when traveling.
- Ubikes are gaining populartity in many places from Taiwan, as Ubike stations expanding rapidly, we thought that linking ubike stations near origin and destination might be a more convenient way to travel.
- Sometimes you can be confused about the messy transfer system in Taiwan, like the timetable of buses are not always precise, and bus stopes are hard to locate. Adding Ubike routes in proper for short distance traveling can shorten the time.
